  "description": "A man-in-the-middle proxy server that can intercept and inspect unencrypted HTTPS traffic on your machine. It achieves this by dynamically creating SSL certificates for each domains it intercepts, completing a TLS handshake with the client, establishing a connection to the destination server, and tunneling the client request to the destination server, and the server response back to the client. For more information on proxies and tunneling see [MDN's Proxy servers and tunneling](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/Proxy_servers_and_tunneling).",
